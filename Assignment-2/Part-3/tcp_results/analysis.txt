=== Analysis and Observations ===

1. Effect of Nagle's Algorithm:
   - Average throughput with Nagle on: 38.93 B/s
   - Average throughput with Nagle off: 38.92 B/s
   - Nagle's algorithm increases throughput by 0.01 B/s (0.03%)

2. Effect of Delayed ACK:
   - Average throughput with Delayed ACK on: 38.92 B/s
   - Average throughput with Delayed ACK off: 38.92 B/s
   - Delayed ACK decreases throughput by 0.00 B/s (0.00%)

3. Best Configuration:
   - nagle_on_delack_on provides the highest goodput at 39.13 B/s

4. Explanation of Observations:
   - Nagle's Algorithm aims to reduce the number of small packets by buffering data until either a full-sized packet can be sent or an ACK is received.
   - Delayed ACK reduces the number of ACKs by delaying them, which can cause Nagle's algorithm to wait unnecessarily.
   - When both are enabled, they can create a 'lock-step' behavior where each is waiting for the other.
   - Disabling both typically gives the best interactive performance but may increase network overhead.

5. Recommendations:
   - For bulk transfers: Nagle on, Delayed ACK on - Reduces overhead, maximizes efficiency
   - For interactive applications: Nagle off, Delayed ACK off - Minimizes latency
   - For mixed workloads: Nagle off, Delayed ACK on - Good compromise
